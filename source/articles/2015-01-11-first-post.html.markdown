Welcome to my new personal website. I've been working on it for several weeks now, on and off. But the website is still far from finished. I feel happy with the overall layout and color scheme, but most sections of the website still need a lot of work. The only page that's close to finished is the contact page. 

You might ask: "If most of the website still needs more work, why am I putting this website online before it's ready?" To which I would reply: "Good point." But a more serious response would be that I just needed the satisfaction of finally having this website uploaded into the internet. Plus the previous occupant of this domain was a dingy landing page. I couldn't stand that anymore.
